<p>My name is Aarron Hecksher and I’m a data scientist. I absolutely love using the R language and exploring the multitude of things you can do (the R community is really amazing!) but Python is starting to grow on me and I’m not real sure how I feel about that ;). I enjoy learning about and creating solutions using machine learning, bayesian data analysis, natural language processing, and time-series analysis.</p>
<p>I graduated from the University of Arkansas with a Bachelors of Science in Industrial Engineering (and the obligatory minor in Mathematics). I was drawn to industrial engineering because the idea of solving complex problems through the thoughtful design, careful observation, and statiscal analysis sounded like a fun way to make a living. I’ve taken and grown that skillset across industries ranging from aerospace/manufacturing at <a href="https://www.spiritaero.com">Spirit Aerosystems</a> to finance/auditing at <a href="https://www.cotiviti.com/connoly">Connolly</a> to my current role in retail/cpg analytics, where I am a founding member for <a href="https://www.atlasdsr.com">Atlas Technology Group</a>.</p>
<p>In my free time you can catch me playing with my daughters, enjoying date nights with my wife, or find me eye balls deep in a data science/stats book or MOOC (I really enjoy <a href="https://www.datacamp.com">DataCamp!</a>)</p>
