My name is Aarron Hecksher and I'm a data scientist.  I absolutely love using the R language and exploring the multitude of things you can do (the R community is really amazing!) but Python is starting to grow on me and I'm not real sure how I feel about that ;).  I enjoy learning about and creating solutions using machine learning, bayesian data analysis, natural language processing, and time-series analysis.

I graduated from the University of Arkansas with a Bachelors of Science in Industrial Engineering (and the obligatory minor in Mathematics).  I was drawn to industrial engineering because the idea of solving complex problems through the thoughtful design, careful observation, and statiscal analysis sounded like a fun way to make a living.  I've taken and grown that skillset across industries ranging from aerospace/manufacturing at [Spirit Aerosystems](https://www.spiritaero.com) to finance/auditing at [Connolly](https://www.cotiviti.com/connoly) to my current role in retail/cpg analytics, where I am a founding member for [Atlas Technology Group](https://www.atlasdsr.com).

In my free time you can catch me playing with my daughters, enjoying date nights with my wife, or find me eye balls deep in a data science/stats book or MOOC (I really enjoy [DataCamp!](https://www.datacamp.com))
